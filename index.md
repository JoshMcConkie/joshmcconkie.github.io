# Hi, I'm Josh 👋

I'm an undergraduate studying **Applied & Computational Mathematics (ACME)** at **BYU**, with an emphasis in **electrical/computer engineering (signals & systems)**.  

I'm especially interested in:

- Robotics and control systems  
- State estimation and Kalman filtering  
- Signals, systems, and embedded hardware  
- Quantum-related engineering (photonics / computation)  
- Using math + code to build real systems

## What I'm Working On

### 🧠 Academics

- **Degree:** Applied & Computational Mathematics (ACME), BYU  
- **Emphasis:** Signals & Systems / Electrical & Computer Engineering  
- **Grad timeline:** Planning to graduate in **April 2028**  

Recent and upcoming coursework includes:

- Multivariable calculus, linear algebra, and computational linear algebra  
- Differential equations and real analysis  
- Circuits, signals & systems, and control systems  
- Data structures, algorithms, and numerical methods  

---

### 🤖 Projects

Some things I like to build and break:

- **Robotics & Control:**  
  Experiments with controllers, state estimation, and physical systems (servo control, sensors, embedded platforms, etc.).

- **Math + Code:**  
  Implementations of numerical methods, filters, and optimization in Python/C++ and exploration of how theory meets hardware.

- **Side Experiments:**  
  3D printing, PCB design, embedded projects, and “let’s see what happens if…” prototypes.

> I care about projects that *actually run*—not just on paper, but on hardware.

## Interests (a non-exhaustive list)

- Control theory & dynamical systems  
- State estimation and Kalman filters  
- Robotics (especially dynamics and feedback)  
- Signals & systems, signal processing  
- Quantum-adjacent engineering and photonics  
- Applied math that touches the real world  
- Teaching, explaining, and communicating technical ideas

---

## Skills & Tools

**Languages**

- Python, C++  
- A growing amount of LaTeX

**Math / CS Areas**


**Tools**

- Git & GitHub  
- Arduino / microcontrollers  
- 3D CAD & basic PCB design  
- VS Code

---

## Values & Long-Term Direction

I’m aiming long-term at work that combines:

- **Deep understanding** (math + physics + engineering)  
- **Hands-on systems** (robots, hardware, real signals)  
- **Teaching & communication** (helping others understand complex ideas)  

I’m interested in paths that lead toward **robotics/control**, **applied math**, or **quantum-related engineering**, likely through graduate school.
